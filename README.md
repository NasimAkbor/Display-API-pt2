# Displaying-API-Info

A front-end made with React that displays information gathered from an online API, https://digimon-api.vercel.app/api/digimon. Through the front end one can search through each object of the API; navigating with the arrows provided. Unfortunately the API is lacking in information and currently only provides a name and photo of a digimon.
